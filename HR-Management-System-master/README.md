# HR Management System
HR Management System is a web-based application designed for a web development company to streamline HR processes. It includes three main roles: Employees, Managers, and HR, each with its own dashboard and functionalities. Employees can manage attendance, view tasks, and request leaves. Managers can oversee employees, assign tasks, and conduct evaluations. HR can manage departments, handle employee records, and process feedback. The system is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, C#, SQL, and ASP.NET Core MVC, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience. Security features like password hashing and network-based login restrictions enhance data protection.
